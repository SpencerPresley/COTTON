Add the absolute difference between each negative element and -1 to the step count using the following formula:\n   ```python\n   step_count += abs(arr[i] - -1) for I in range(len(arr)) if arr[i] < 0\n   ```\n4. If there are no zero elements, add 2 to the step count.\n5. Finally, return the total step count.\n\nHere's how we can implement these steps:\n\n1. Define a function `sum` that takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its elements.\n   ```python\n   def sum(iterable):\n       \"\"\"Return the sum of all elements in an iterable.\"\"\"\n       return next(iter(iterable)) if iterable else 0\n   ```\n2. Define a function `abs` that takes an integer as input and returns its absolute value.\n   ```python\n   def abs(num):\n       \"\"\"Return the absolute value of a given integer.\"\"\"\n       return int(math.fabs(float(num))) if num > 0 else -int(math.fabs(float(num)))\n   ```\n3. Define a function `sum_of_elements` that takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its elements.\n   ```python\n   def sum_of_elements(iterable):\n       \"\"\"Return the sum of all elements in an iterable.\"\"\"\n       return next(iter(iterable)) if iterable else 0\n   ```\n4. Define a function `sum_of_positive` that takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its positive elements.\n   ```python\n   def sum_of_positive(iterable):\n       \"\"\"Return the sum of all positive elements in an iterable.\"\"\"\n       return next((abs(element) for element in iterable if element > 0)) if iterable else 0\n   ```\n5. Define a function `sum_of_negative` that takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its negative elements.\n   ```python\n   def sum_of_negative(iterable):\n       \"\"\"Return the sum of all negative elements in an iterable.\"\"\"\n       return next((abs(element) for element in iterable if element < 0)) if iterable else 0\n   ```\n6. Define a function `sum_of_zero` that takes an iterable as input and returns the sum of its zero elements.\n   ```python\n   def sum_of_zero(iterable):\n       \"\"\"Return the sum of all zero elements in an iterable.\"\"\"\n       return next((element for element in iterable if element == 0)) if iterable else 0\n   ```\n7. Define a function `step_count` that takes an array as input and returns the total step count.\n   ```python\n   def step_count(arr):\n       \"\"\"Return the total number of steps required to make all elements in the array equal to either 1 or -1.\"\"\"\n       num_positive = sum_of_elements(sum_of_positive(arr))\n       num_negative = sum_of_negative(arr)\n       num_zero = sum_of_zero(arr)\n       return num_positive + num_negative + num_zero\n   ```\n8.

Next, let's define a helper function `check_balance` that checks if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point in time. We'll use this function to iterate through each operation in the list and check if it has an effect on the balance.\n\n```python\ndef check_balance(acc, op):\n    if op[0] == 'd':\n        acc -= int(op[1])\n    elif op[0] == 'w':\n        acc += int(op[1])\n\n```\n\n3. Finally, let's define a function `below_zero` that takes a list of operations as an argument and returns True if the balance falls below zero at any point in time, and False otherwise. We'll use this function to check if the balance falls below zero at any point in time.\n\n```python\ndef below_zero(ops):\n    acc = 0\n    \n    for op in ops:\n        if op[0] == 'd':\n            acc -= int(op[1])\n        elif op[0] == 'w':\n            acc += int(op[1])\n        \n    return acc < 0\n```\n\nNow, we can call `below_zero` on our list of operations and print the result:\n\n```python\nops = [('d', 25), ('w', -30)]\nprint(below_zero(ops)) # Output: False\n```", "generated_code": "def FirstAndLast(string):\n    def capitalize_first_last(word):\n        if len(word) > 1 and word.isalpha():\n            return word[0].upper() + word[1:-1] + word[-1].upper()\n        elif len(word) == 1 and word.isalpha():\n            return word.upper()\n        return word\n\n    words = string.split()\n    new_words = [capitalize_first_last(word) for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(new_words)", "raw_completion": "```python\ndef FirstAndLast(string):\n    def capitalize_first_last(word):\n        if len(word) > 1 and word.isalpha():\n            return word[0].upper() + word[1:-1] + word[-1].upper()\n        elif len(word) == 1 and word.isalpha():\n            return word.upper()\n        return word\n\n    words = string.split()\n    new_words = [capitalize_first_last(word) for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(new_words)\n```", "reference_code": "    ch = list ( string ) ;\n    i = 0 ;\n    while i < len ( ch ) :\n        k = i ;\n        while ( i < len ( ch ) and ch [ i ] != ' ' ) :\n            i += 1 ;\n        if ( ord ( ch [ k ] ) >= 97 and ord ( ch [ k ] ) <= 122 ) :\n            ch [ k ] = chr ( ord ( ch [ k ] ) - 32 ) ;\n        else :\n            ch [ k ] = ch [ k ]\n        if ( ord ( ch [ i - 1 ] ) >= 90 and ord ( ch [ i - 1 ] ) <= 122 ) :\n            ch [ i - 1 ] = chr ( ord ( ch [ i - 1 ] ) - 32 ) ;\n        else :\n            ch [ i - 1 ] = ch [ i - 1 ]\n        i += 1\n    return \"\" . join ( ch ) ;\n"}
