Next, let's define the `ReuleauxArea` function that takes a radius as input and returns the area of a Reuleaux triangle with that radius. We can do this by defining a helper function `calculate_area` that calculates the area of a Reuleaux triangle using the formula:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_area(radius):\n    \"\"\" Calculates the area of a Reuleaux triangle with given radius. \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calculate base and height of triangle\n    base = math.sqrt(3) * radius**2\n    height = 2*radius\n    \n    # Calculate area of triangle\n    return (base + height)/6\n```\n\n3. Finally, let's call the `below_zero` function with our input list and calculate the area of a Reuleaux triangle using the helper function:\n\n```python\nresult = below_zero(operations)\narea = calculate_area(radius)\n\nif result is True:\n    print(\"The account balance falls below zero.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The account balance is greater than or equal to zero.\")\n    \n# Output: The account balance falls below zero. ```\n```", "generated_code": "import math\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n     zero balance.
