Finally, we can call both functions together to implement the `below_zero` function:\n\n```python\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.

Finally, we can call the `below_zero` function with our list of operations:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    operations = [10, -5, 2, 8]\n    print(below_zero(operations)) # Output: False\n```\n\nThis will output \"False\" as expected.", "generated_code": "from typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.
