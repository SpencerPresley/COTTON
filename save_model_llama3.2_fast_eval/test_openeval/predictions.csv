"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize maxLength as 0 and currentLength as 1.
Step 2. Iterate through the array.
    -If the product of the current element and the previous element is non-negative, update maxLength to currentLength and currentLength to 1.
    -If the product of the current element and the previous element is negative, update maxLength to currentLength and currentLength to max(currentLength, currentLength - currentLength - 1).
Step 3. Return maxLength."
